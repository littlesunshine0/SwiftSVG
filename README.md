# SwiftSVG

A lightweight and performant macOS application for browsing, viewing, and managing SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics) files, built with modern SwiftUI.

## Features

- **High-Fidelity SVG Rendering:** Renders SVGs accurately into native SwiftUI views.
- **Multiple View Layouts:** Browse your SVG library in a familiar **List**, a compact **Grid**, or a beautiful **Gallery** view.
- **Robust File Management:** Easily import individual SVG files or scan entire folders to build your collection.
- **Performant Thumbnails:** Asynchronous thumbnail generation ensures a smooth and responsive user experience, even with large libraries.
- **Error Handling:** Gracefully handles invalid or malformed SVG files, displaying a fallback error image instead of crashing.
- **Debug Mode:** A built-in debug mode to inspect rendering and parsing behavior.

## How to Use

1. Launch the application.
2. Use the `...` menu in the toolbar to **Import Files** or **Scan Folder**.
3. Use the layout switcher in the toolbar to change between List, Grid, and Gallery views.
4. Select an SVG from the library to see it rendered in the main preview pane.
